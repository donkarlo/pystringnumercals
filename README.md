# About pystringnumericals Application
 * The goal of this project is to provide utilities for big numbers numerical calculations by fitting them in frame of python strings

# Sample output:
>  Enter the first integer: 374658736485638458374
>  Enter the second integer: -998894758346583948593845987394
>  -374244648044258302619363612999997004365607997737356

# Methodology
 * It first decides whether the result is negative or positive based on the fisrt signs of the input numbers. The idea is to read the string numbers from the prompt and then multyplying the last digit of the second number by the first number and this will be continued until all digits are multiplied. Finally the stored results will summed up together. Please follow the comments in the code as the code talks well for itself.  

# How to use?
 * python3 /path/to/pystringnumercals/integer.py
